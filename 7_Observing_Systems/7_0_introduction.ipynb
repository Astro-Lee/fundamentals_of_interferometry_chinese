    "When thinking about engineering and the development of an instrument from a practical point of view the key concept to get across is that *any measurement is a loss in information and is noisy*. In the case of astronomy, there is the potential to measure infinite frequency bandwidth, frequency resolution, time bandwidth, and time resolution across a $4\\pi$ area of the sky. In reality, the instruments that we can build have limits on all these parameters, so we must be selective about which information we retain based on the scientific goals and engineering limitations when an instrument is build and how it is used.\n",

For astronomy, we would *want* to measure over an infinitely large bandwidth in both frequency and time, at an infinitely fine resolution in frequency and time, and across a $4\\pi$ area of the sky. In *practice*, the instruments we **can** build have limits on all these parameters, and so we must choose what information we retain  and what information we sacrifice... - based on our scientific goals, current engineering limitations, and budget when an instrument is conceived - taking into account how we intend to build it and how we intend to use it.\n",

These effects are seperated into two types: *direction-independent effects (DIEs)* which affects signals from al direction of the sky in the same way and *direction-dependent effects (DDEs)* which vary based on the sky position of the where a signal originated. For example, the gain of a source due to it's position relative to the direction a dish is pointed is a direction-dependent effect. If the dish is moved the source will either increase or descrease in gain based on the *beam pattern* of the dish. And, the variations due to the electronic stability of the system is a direction-independent effect because the effect happens after the signal has been received.\n",
