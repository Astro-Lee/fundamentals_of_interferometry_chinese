Jones notation gives us a mathematical way of describing these corruptions. The business of estimating and removing the corruptions is called **calibration** and is dealt with in [$\\S$ 8 &#10142;](../8_Calibration/8_0_Introduction.ipynb).

Recall from [$\\S$ 5 &#10142;](../5_Imaging/5_2_sampling_functions_and_psfs.ipynb) that an interferometer samples a limited set of spatial frequencies, bound by its shortest and longest baselines. Therefore, if the $I$ flux varies smoothly over the sky (i.e. has very low spatial frequencies, or large spatial scales) while the polarized $QU$ varies on smaller scales, it is quite possible for the interferometer to \"see\" less (or even no) $I$ flux, and significant $QU$ flux. This is in fact the case when observing near the plane of the Milky Way: unpolarized synchrotron radiation from around the galactic plane is very smooth (on the order of degrees), and gets mostly suppressed, while the *polarized foregrounds* show smaller-scale structure (on the order of arcminutes) that is quite apparent to most interefometers.
